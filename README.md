## CoDUO-X

A modding framework inspired by CoDaM for vCoD. Basically I have been tired of running up on memory issues and other CoDUO engine issues and so I am writing a framework to help me avoid those issues

### Features
* better callback_playerconnect menu handling
* modlist support for running multiple types of mods per gametype (PAM SD, AWE CTF, etc)
* extensible gametype tweaking - modular respawn options (adding reinforcement to objective gametypes, objective style, single life rounds to CTF etc)
